    <b><h4 class="pad">B. RULES AND REGULATIONS</b></h4>
    <p class="padd">
<br>
<br><b>1. DURATION AND COVERAGE</b>
<br>a. The duration of national service shall be one year for ALL Ghanaian graduates who complete approved tertiary courses. This is regardless of the type of sponsorship of courses, and whether or not such courses were pursued in Ghana.
<br>b. Personnel who did the one-year non-graduate service shall be required to undertake one year post-tertiary national service.
<br>c. The National Service Board shall announce the date for the commencement of national service by all fresh entrants. National service usually commences in the month of September.
<br>d. The Board reserves the right to review the period of service.
<br>
<br><b>2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br></b>
a. The National Service Secretariat is the authority on national service appointments. Heads of User-Agencies should, therefore deal only with personnel who have valid appointment letters issued by the Secretariat.<br>
b. National Service Personnel are subject to all rules and regulations governing the establishment to which they have been posted. However, where such rules and regulations conflict with those of the National Service Scheme, the rules and regulations of the Scheme shall take precedence over those of the establishment.<br>

c. With the exception of study leave graduates/diplomates, all service personnel shall be paid a consolidated non-taxable monthly allowance approved by the Ministry of Finance, which shall be stated on the appointment letter.<br>

<br>d. Study leave graduates and diplomates shall, having passed through the appropriate channels of the Scheme, return to their mother organisations, earn their promotions, if any, and be placed on the minimum level of the new grade. However, there shall be a freeze on their increment and promotions thereafter until they successfully complete their service.
<br>
<br><b>3. MONTHLY ALLOWANCE</b>
<br>Payment of allowances to service personnel shall be made in the following manner:
<br>a. National Service Personnel shall be entitled to the payment of monthly allowances, the level of which shall be determined by the Ministry of Finance.
<br>b. Payment of allowances to service personnel shall be calculated from the date the service person reports for duty and or begins work for the first time at his/her place of posting.
<br>c. National service personnel posted to schools and colleges under the Ghana Education Service, Ministries, Government Departments and establishments shall be paid from funds lodged with the government treasuries by the National Service Secretariat.
<br>
<br>d. National Service Personnel posted to Statutory Boards, Corporations and churches or quasi-church organisations shall be paid by those establishments from their own resources.
<br>
<br>e. National Service Personnel posted to private companies shall be paid their allowances by those companies. In addition, the companies will pay a service charge equivalent to 20% of their basic service allowance monthly by payment order to the Executive Director, National Service Secretariat. Posting of personnel to these institutions will be made on an understanding of the acceptance of this condition by these institutions. However, private educational institutions shall be exempted from <br>paying this percentage to the Secretariat.
<br>
<br><b>4. POSTING/PLACEMENT CRITERIA</b>
<br>a. The posting/placement consideration of service personnel is determined by an interplay of a number of factors including the following:
<br>i. National programmes
<br>ii. Policy priorities
<br>iii. Courses pursued
<br>iv. Choice of region
<br>v. Requests from user agencies
<br>vi. Human resource demand and supply
<br>vii. Extreme health conditions
<br>viii. Social integration
<br>ix. Regional balance
<br>x. Personnel re-orientation etc.
<br>b. At the request of a Service Person, his/her original place of posting may be changed on health grounds. Written petitions may be accompanied by the relevant medical documents.
<br>
<br><b>5. LEAVES</b>
<br>a. Annual leave
<br>Personnel shall be entitled to a one-month terminal leave in any normal service year.
<br>b. Maternity leave
<br>Where it becomes necessary for a woman on national service to proceed on maternity leave, she would be required to serve for three additional months to make up for the period of service lost. Heads of user-agencies and employers are expected to inform both the Executive Director and the Regional Directors of the Scheme before anyone proceeds on maternity leave and on resumption of duty. While on maternity leave they will not be paid allowances.
<br>c. Allowances in lieu of leave
<br>If for any reason User-agencies are unable to allow national service personnel to enjoy annual leave, the organisations shall arrange to pay one monthâ€™s allowance, in lieu of the leave, from their own resources.
