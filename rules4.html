<br><b>INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR NATIONAL YOUTH SERVICE (IANYS)</b>
<br>At the global level, there is an International Association for National Youth Service (IANYS). This is made up of member organisations from countries, not only in Africa, but also in Europe, Australia and North America as well. Other African countries which have national youth service programmes include Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Namibia and the Gambia.
<br>National youth service (NYS) is an organised activity in which young people serve others and the environment in ways that contribute positively to society.
<br>National youth service serves both individual and community needs through several and varied youth interventions. These programmes or interventions:
<br>a. Offer opportunities for young people to serve others, while supporting them in their activities and recognising the value of the service.
<br>b. Provide young people with opportunities to acquire skills in order to become productive members of their societies.
<br>c. Enable young people to be active participants in their own development.
<br>From the preamble of the IANYS Charter, NYS:
<br>a. Fosters nation building, strengthens communities, accomplishes important human and environmental services, and is a positive instrument for youth development.
<br>
<br>b. Promotes mutual understanding among diverse groups as well as global peace and co-operation; deserves consideration by all countries as a major youth policy.
